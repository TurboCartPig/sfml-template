# SFML Template with cmake

This template automatically downloads SFML and compiles it from source, and builds a sample SFML application.

## How to use

1. Obtain this git repo somehow (Clone it, fork it, use it as a template in Github)
2. cd into the folder
3. Run `cmake -S . -B build` to configure it for building with the default generator for your platform (Visual Studio on Windows)
4. Run `cmake --build build/` to build SFML and the sample application included
5. Run ./build/window to test the built application
6. ???
7. Profit!
